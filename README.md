📊 BANKING ANALYTICS WITH PYTHON AND POWER BI

This project explores a synthetic banking dataset to uncover patterns in customer behavior, estimated income band, and risk indicators. It involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python and building an interactive dashboard in Power BI to communicate key insights effectively.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies

Python: Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA using pandas, matplotlib, seaborn

Power BI: Interactive dashboard design for stakeholder presentation

Jupyter Notebook: For documenting analysis steps and code

📈 Dashboard Features

Summary statistics of customer income, savings, loans

Visual breakdowns by banking relationship, gender, and institutional advisor

Bank deposit and loan patterns by occupation and nationality

🧠 Key Insights

Customers who maintain high balances in one account type often hold substantial amount/funds across other accounts as well.
